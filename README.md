Repository of my personal homepage. *The template of my homepage is designed to serve as a personal portfolio of my work, as well as a representation of my resume.*

The style of my homepage is built with [Bootstrap Material Design](https://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/), [the AOS Library](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) and some of my own styles.

Note: Use react-spring and Material-UI built in animations in future (if basic page is nearly done)

It also uses the scripts of Bootstrap Material Design (includes popper.js, jquery-3.5.1), the AOS Library and some of my own scripts.

This is the first version of my homepage, running for almost 1 year. Now it's time to re-design it!

**Current tasks:**
| Priority | Task |
| -------- | ---- |
| `high`   | update MD Bootstrap version |
| `high`   | add/change content |
| `medium` | update whole design and template |
| `medium` | update/change animations |
| `low`    | add dark/light mode |
| `low`    | implement language settings |
| `low`    | create 'CMS'-like software |

**Normal updates:**

Desgin/Template changes:
1. change HTML structure
2. check for Google Console errors and fix them
3. update scripts

Animation changes:
1. don't use left/right fade in AOS
2. look for updated aos version

Dark/light mode:
1. use time to change theme color automatically
2. use toggle to set theme color manually

**Further updates (wishes):**

Language settings:
1. IP based language settings (via HTTP respond?)
2. User Agent languate settings (get User Agent language settings?)

CMS-like software:
* Online CMS:
  * create Angular app to manage page content
  * when hitting 'save', create HTML, CSS, JS files?
* Offline 'CMS':
  * create whole HTML, CSS, JS and use placeholders
  * fill placeholders in own file format
  * use Python (or something else) to change placeholders with real content
